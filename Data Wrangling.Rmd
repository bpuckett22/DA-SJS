## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

```{r}
(jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1))
```

```{r}
(dec25 <- filter(flights, month == 12, day == 25))
```

### 5.2.1 Comparisions 

==, >, >=, <, <=, !

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1)
```

```{r}
cos(pi/2)
```

```{r}

```

5.2.2 Logical Operators 

or -----> | (above the 'return' key)
and -----> &
not -----> !

Flights that departed in November **or** December

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12 )
```

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 5 | month == 6 | month == 7 | month == 8)
```

```{r}
filter(flights, month %in% c(5, 6, 7, 8) )
```

flights that weren't delayed (on departure or arrival) by more than two hours.
```{r}
filter(flights, (dep_delay > 120 | arr_delay > 120))
```

```{r}
filter(flights, dep_delay <= 120 & arr_delay <= 120)
```

### 5.2.3 Missing Values 

NA = "not available" 

```{r}
100 == NA
2 > NA
x <- NA
is.na(x)
```

How do I get rid of NA's on my dataset 

```{r}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
filter(flights, !is.na(dep_time))
withoutNA <- filter(flights, !is.na(dep_time))
withoutNA

filter(withoutNA, !is.na(dep_time))
```

### 5.2.4 Exercises 

> 1. Find all flights that 

Had an arrival delay of two or more hours

```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
```

That flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

```{r}
filter(flights, dest == 'IAH' | dest == 'HOU')
filter(flights, dest %in% c('IAH', 'HOU'))
```

were operated by United (UA), American (AA), or Delta (DL)

```{r}
filter(flights, carrier %in% c('UA', 'AA', 'DL'))
```

departed in the summer (july, august, and September)

```{r}
filter(flights, month %in% c('7', '8', '9'))
```

arrived more than 2 hours late, but (AND) didn't leave late 

```{r}
filter(flights, arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0)
```

were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

```{r}
filter(flights, dep_delay >= 60, dep_delay - arr_delay > 30)
```

Departed between midnight and 6am (inclusive)

```{r}
filter (flights, between(dep_time, 00, 600))
```


> 2. Another useful dplyr filtering helper is between (). What does it do? Can you use it to simplify the code needed to answer the previous challenges?

```{r}
filter (flights, between(dep_time, 00, 600))
```

> 3. How many flights have a missing dep_time? What other variables are missing? What might these rows represent?

```{r}
filter(flights, is.na(dep_time))
```

# 5.3 Arrange rows with arrage()

```{r}
arrange(flights, dep_delay, month, day)
```

Use desc() to re-order by a coumn in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

**Missing values are always sorted at the end**

```{r}
#newDatabase <- filter(flights, !is.na(dep_delay))
```

### 5.3.1 Exercises 

> 3. Sort the flights to find the fastest (highest speed) flights.

```{r}
arrange(flights, air_time) #incorrect

arrange(flights, desc(distance / air_time))
```

> 4. Which flights travelled the farthest? Which travelled the shortest?

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(distance))

arrange(flights, distance)
```

### 5.4 Select columns with select()

```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)

select(flights, year:day)

select(flights, -(year:day))
```

There are a number of helper functions you can use within select():

starts_with()
ends_with()
contains()

```{r}
select(flights, starts_with('dep'))
select(flights, ends_with('delay'))
select(flights, contains('_'))
```

select() can be used to rename variables, but it’s rarely useful because it drops all of the variables not explicitly mentioned. Instead, use rename(), which is a variant of select() that keeps all the variables that aren’t explicitly mentioned:

```{r}
rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum)
```

Another option is to use select() in conjunction with the everything() helper. This is useful if you have a handful of variables you’d like to move to the start of the data frame.

```{r}
flights

select(flights, dep_delay, arr_delay, everything())
```

### 5.4.1 exercises

> 1. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select dep_time, dep_delay, arr_time, and arr_delay from flights.

```{r}
select(flights, starts_with('dep') | starts_with('arr'))
select(flights, ends_with('delay') | ends_with('time'))
```

> 2. What happens if you include the name of a variable multiple times in a select() call?

```{r}
select(flights, air_time, distance, air_time)
```

 Add new variables with mutate()
 
 Make a new data set called "flights_narrow" 
 
```{r}
flights_narrow <- select(flights, year: day, ends_with('delay'), distance, air_time)

flights_narrow
```
 
 Use the mutate() function to create two new columns; gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, and speed = distance / air_time * 60
 
```{r}
mutate(flights_narrow, gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, speed = distance / air_time * 60)
```
 
 Note that you can refer to columns that you've just created:
 
```{r}
mutate(flights_narrow, gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, speed = distance / air_time * 60, gain_per_hour = gain / air_time)
```
 
 If you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute()
 
```{r}
transmute(flights, gain = dep_delay - arr_delay, speed = distance / air_time * 60, gain_per_hour = gain / air_time)
```
 
 # 5.6 Grouped summaries with summarize()
 
 The last key verb is summarize(). It collapses a data frame to a single row:
 
```{r}
summarize(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```
 
summarize() is not terribly useful unless we pair it with group_by(). This changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups. Then, when you use the dplyr verbs on a grouped data frame they’ll be automatically applied “by group”. For example, if we applied exactly the same code to a data frame grouped by date, we get the average delay per date:

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)

summarize(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
by_carrier <- group_by(flights, carrier)

summarize(by_carrier, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
by_airport <- group_by(flights, origin)

summarize(by_airport, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r}
by_airTime <- group_by(flights, air_time)

summarize(by_airTime, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### 5.6.1 Combining multiple operations with the pipe

Imagine that we want to explore the relationship between the distance and average delay for each location. Using what you know about dplyr, you might write code like this:

Group flights by destenation:

```{r}
by_dest <- group_by(flights, dest)
```

Summarize to compute distance, average delay, and number of flights.

```{r}
delays <- summarize(by_dest, count = n(), dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
delays
```

Visualize your data:
make a scatter plot of distance vs delay, with count mapped to the size aes. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = delays) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay, size = count ))
```

remove "noisy" points

```{r}
delays <- filter(delays, count > 20, dest != 'HNL')

delays
```

vizulaize data again:

```{r}
ggplot(data = delays) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay, size = count))
```

Clean up your plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
```

```{r}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarize(count = n(), dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE), delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(count > 20, dest != 'HNL') 
ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) 
```

### 5.6.2 Missing Values 

You may have wondered about the na.rm argument we used above. What happens if we don’t set it?

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

is.na(variable) - asks a question - is the variable NA?
na.rm = TRUE - gives a command - remove all NA

```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>%
  filter(! is.na(arr_delay) & !is.na(dep_delay))
```

### 5.6.3 Counts 

Whenever you do any aggregation, it’s always a good idea to include either a count (n()), or a count of non-missing values (sum(!is.na(x))). That way you can check that you’re not drawing conclusions based on very small amounts of data. For example, let’s look at the planes (identified by their tail number) that have the highest average delays:

```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay))

delays

arrange(delays, desc(delay))
```

Wow, there are some planes that have an average delay of 5 hours (300 minutes)!

The story is actually a little more nuanced. We can get more insight if we draw a scatterplot of number of flights vs. average delay:

```{r}
delays <- not_cancelled %>%
  group_by(tailnum) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay), count = n())

arrange(delays, desc(delay))

ggplot(data = delays) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = count, y = delay, alpha = 1/3))
```

Not surprisingly, there is much greater variation in the average delay when there are few flights. The shape of this plot is very characteristic: whenever you plot a mean (or other summary) vs. group size, you’ll see that the variation decreases as the sample size increases.

When looking at this sort of plot, it’s often useful to filter out the groups with the smallest numbers of observations, so you can see more of the pattern and less of the extreme variation in the smallest groups. This is what the following code does, as well as showing you a handy pattern for integrating ggplot2 into dplyr flows. It’s a bit painful that you have to switch from %>% to +, but once you get the hang of it, it’s quite convenient.

```{r}
delays %>%
  filter(count > 25) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = count, y = delay, alpha = 0.1))
  
```

There’s another common variation of this type of pattern. Let’s look at how the average performance of batters in baseball is related to the number of times they’re at bat. Here I use data from the Lahman package to compute the batting average (number of hits / number of attempts) of every major league baseball player.

```{r}
Batting
```

```{r}
batting <- Batting 

batters <- batting %>%
  group_by(playerID) %>%
  summarize(ba = sum(H, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(AB, na.rm = TRUE), ab = sum(AB))

batters %>%
  filter(ab > 100) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ab, y = ba)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
